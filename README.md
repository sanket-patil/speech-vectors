#### Towards learning "good" representations for speech data.


The paper is about learning good representations of input data. Good representations are useful as inputs to a predictor (classifier or a regressor). They also capture the underlying patterns very well.
- Since representations are crucial, feature engineering has been central to machine learning.
- However, it would be great if we can learn representations automatically. This paper reviews ways of doing it using deep learning methods
    - deep learning methods learn compositions of representations (hierarchy of representations)
    - learning yields more abstract, hence more useful representations.
